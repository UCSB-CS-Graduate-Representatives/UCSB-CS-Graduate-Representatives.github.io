Positions
=======

The graduate representatives (GREPs) are members of our CS graduate student 
community that serve on a number of departmental committees to represent
our interests and coordinate various events and activities throughout 
the year. Some of the elected GREPs also serve as the department 
representatives to the [Graduate StudentAssociation (GSA)](http://ucsbgsa.org).

The elections for these positions are [conducted annually]({{site.baseurl}}/elections/), typically before
the academic year starts. The current GREPs facilitate the elections and
help with onboarding of the new GREPs. The departmental Student Affairs Manager 
supports the representatives, but it is the responsibility of the representatives
to carry out their duties, as outlined below. (Click on the positions to know more about them).

[Executive Committee](#facilities_committee): Comprises of a secretary, treasurer, and a president. <br/>
[GSA Representatives](#gsa_representatives): Represent the CS graduate students at GSA meetings. <br/>
[Recruitment Committee](#recruitment_committee) : Facilitating the faculty recruitment process. <br/>
[Facilities Committee](#facilities_committee) : Coordinate *facility-related* issues (rooms, grad lounge, etc) <br/>
[Graduate Affairs Committee](#grad_affairs_committee) : Represent students / TAs at CS Graduate affairs committee. <br/>
[Graduate Admissions Committee](#grad_admissions_committee)	: Facilitating the graduate student recruitment process. <br/>
[Undergraduate Curriculum Committee](#undergrad_curriculum_committee) : Changes to undergraduate courses, class schedules etc <br/>
[Coffee Hour Committee](#coffee_hour_committee) : Facilitating the very popular coffee hour event <br/>
[CS Summit Committee](#department_day_committee) : Help with [CS summit](http://www.ucsb-cs-summit.com/) <br/>
[Diversity Committee](#diversity_committee)	: Coordinating outreach and diversity efforts. <br/>

<!-- These representatives are elected each 
year from the graduate student body. Additionally, representatives take 
positions on a number of departmental committees to ensure our views are 
considered. If you would like to fill one of these positions, please

<h2 id="commitee_executives">Committee Executives</h2>
The elected GREPs select from among themselves a secretary, treasurer, and 
president. The secretary keeps the meeting minutes and distributes them via 
e-mail to all GREPs. The treasurer tracks the GREPs' funds and manages the 
budget for the Spring BBQ. The president calls meetings as appropriate (at 
least once per month) and runs the election for the next term with the help of 
the representative to the Public Relations Committee.

<h2 id="gsa_representatives">GSA Representatives</h2>

It is the responsibility of our department representatives (1 or 2) to the GSA, 
to attend the General Assembly meetings and represent the Computer Science 
graduate students. Representatives are responsible for passing along to the 
department’s graduate students, any relevant information presented at the 
meetings. Stay in communication with the Student Affairs Manager and provide 
monthly updates. GSA Assembly meetings occur monthly (first Tuesday of every 
month) between 6pm and 8pm. Regular attendance is important as the GSA provides 
funding to the GREPs proportional to their attendance. 

<h2 id="recruitment_committee">Recruitment Committee</h2>
The Recruitment Committee representative participates in the recruitment of 
faculty candidates in the department. This committee prepares for recruitment 
in October, then reviews the applications around December and invites qualified 
recruits to interview for available faculty positions beginning in January 
through April. The graduate student representative arranges the lunch meetings 
that these recruits have with the graduate students and collects feedback to 
report back to the committee. Being the graduate student representative to the 
Recruitment Committee may be of major interest to those intending to apply for 
faculty positions later in their career. Meetings are held approximately once 
per week beginning in October.
 
 <h2 id="facilities_committee">Facilities Committee</h2>
 The student representative on the facilities committee serves as a 
communicator between the grad students, faculty, and staff on all facilities 
issues. “Facilities” includes both the physical spaces of the department as 
well as its computer systems. The representative gathers student comments, 
concerns, and complaints, and presents these to the committee. Additionally, 
the representative coordinates with staff and faculty members on the planning 
of facilities changes. Finally, the representative keeps the student body 
well-informed of any facilities issues and their resolution. Keeps in regular 
monthly contact with the committee chair. 

 <h2 id="grad_affairs_committee">Graduate Affairs Committee</h2>
 The student representative on the Graduate Affairs Committee is responsible 
for gathering and voicing the suggestions and complaints of the graduate 
student body with regards to any issues that pertain to their academic life. 
Example issues that have fallen upon this committee are: restructuring of 
screening exams, rising GSR salary levels and early planning/expanding of 
courses offered by the department. They also participate in the student 
excellence award process. The Lead TA serves as the representative on this 
committee and is in regular contact with the Faculty Graduate Advisor (Vice 
Chair of the Dept.) and Student Affairs Manager. The committee meets at least 
once per month and possibly more frequently winter and spring quarters.

<h2 id="grad_admissions_committee">Graduate Admissions Committee</h2>
 The Graduate Admissions Committee processes all of the new graduate student 
applications for the department, and selects the most promising candidates for 
acceptance to the program. The graduate student committee member has the 
responsibility of monitoring these activities and contributing to the selection 
process. The representative also plays a critical role in graduate student 
recruitment visits by coordinating lunches with the candidates and graduate 
students. The committee meets once per month beginning in late October.

<h2 id="undergrad_curriculum_committee">Undergraduate Curriculum Committee</h2>
 The Undergraduate Curriculum Committee discusses changes to undergraduate 
courses, class schedules, and estimates the number of students that will enroll 
in each course. Committee members meet to discuss changes to course 
descriptions and course material. Also, student evaluation statistics are 
discussed in detail and any appropriate changes are recommended. The committee 
consists of five faculty and one graduate student representative. The committee 
meets every other week beginning in October.
 
<h2 id="coffee_hour_committee">Coffee Hour Committee</h2>
 The Coffee Hour Committee is responsible for coordinating department Coffee 
Hours throughout the school year. Coffee Hours are weekly, casual meetings that 
provide a venue for grad students and faculty to mingle and learn more about 
the research that is going on the department. The grad student representatives 
sitting on the committee will coordinate logistics with the office, such as 
budgeting, scheduling, food ordering, and advertising. Stays is close contact 
with the Student Affairs Manager.

<h2 id="department_day_committee">CS Summit Committee</h2>
 This representative will work with faculty and staff in organization of the 
event, which will be a full-day department-wise event showcasing the great work 
done in our department. In particular, this student will work as the Program 
Committee (PC) Chair for the research track of the event, which replaces our 
former Graduate Student Workshop on Computing (GSWC). (updates coming)

<h2 id="diversity_committee">Diversity Committee</h2>
 The Diversity Committee is responsible for coordinating outreach and diversity 
efforts in the department. The graduate student representative will attend the 
Diversity Committee meetings and provide input, as the representative acts as 
the interface between the committee and diversity-promoting groups within the 
department, such as Women in Computer Science (WICS). Meetings may be once per 
month or more frequently.
