Candidates
=======

Victor Amelkin, 6th Year
---
I am a sixth-year PhD Candidate in the CS department, doing research in network science. I have been both an RA and a TA, having spent the recent years RAing at DBL. In the past, I served as a GSA representative, and now I would like to contribute as a member of one of the committees---grad admissions, undergrad curriculum, facilities, grad senate. During the last few years, I have helped a number of people with their application to PhD programs in STEM, and this experience can help the grad admissions committee. I have also taken enough courses and have spent enough time in industry to understand in which direction the undergrad curriculum should evolve. Additionally, I have some experience dealing with the chair, which can help the grad student senate. Finally, I have had experience dealing with UCSB's computing infrastructure, from the desktops at DBL to the CNSI's clusters, which is relevant to the facilities committee. I would be happy to serve our department in 2016-17.

I'm a first year PhD student and I've joined PhD after completing my bachelors this year. During my bachelors, I felt that there has to be an improvement in the way teachers and students interact with each other. And this has to start right from selecting the faculties and designing the coursework for students. That's the reason I've applied to these posts. Though what I can do as a graduate representative in these committees, is limited, I would feel really content if I can contribute something in these matters.

I am running for the Graduate Student Senate to keep improving the graduate student life and work (research and teaching) in the department. I am currently a member of the senate and enjoyed working there, thus I would like to continue to do so.

Alex Jones, 2nd Year
---
I am a second year PhD student looking to meet and bring together students and faculty in the CS department. My research interests are broad and I find it exciting to hear what research is being done by others in the department. I'd like to run for coffee hour committee to facilitate and expand this engaging social aspect of grad life.

Kevin Deweese, 6th Year

I'm a 6th year PhD student in our department running for a position on the graduate admissions committee. Meeting with graduate students during visit weekend greatly impacted my first impressions of UCSB and our department and I want to make sure this continues to be a worthwhile experience for prospective students. I've also always wanted to know what it's like to be on the other side of a stack of applications. With your support, I know we can make the CS department great again MCSGA.

Yun Zhao, 1st Year

I am a 1st year PhD. And was lucky enough to receive the Chancellor's Fellowship. I have incredible interests for being the graduate student representative to the Recruitment Committee. I love teaching and research and  really want to apply for faculty positions later in my career. 

Pratik Soni,

I am a member of the Cryptography group and a part of the Theoretical Computation Lab. Theory@UCSB over the years has enjoyed a lacklustre response from both the graduate and the undergraduate students. I believe there is lack of awareness about the research carried out in our theory groups, thereby promoting little interest among students, especially undergrads. If given an opportunity to serve as a member of the Senate, I would like to create better awareness about research in theory by organising theory-related seminars throughout the year. Through such seminars, I would like provide a platform for students to pursue/enjoy theory beyond their principal interests. Being on the Senate as a representative of the Theoretical Computation lab will be instrumental in executing the plans outlined above.
