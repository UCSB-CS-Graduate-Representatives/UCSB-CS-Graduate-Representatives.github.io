Hi all! I'm a Ph.D. student here in sunny Santa Barbara and very pleased to serve as a graduate representative for the CS department. This is my first of hopefully many years of serving as a representative, and I've a couple of ideas I want to see through to make UCSB a more pleasant place for graduate students (as crazy as that sounds).

I am being advised by Professor Ambuj Singh and working in collaboration with the Brain Imaging Center, studying how brain connectivity (the white stuff in your brain) can change -- within an indivdual, between individuals, and between groups of patients. Previously, I worked at Nox Medical where I studied how sleep can go awry.
