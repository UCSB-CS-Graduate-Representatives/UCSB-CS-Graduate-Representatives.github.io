  Hi, my name is Veronika and I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at UCSB. My personal web page is here: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~veronika/ . 
  
This past year (2015-2016) I served on the Diversity Committee and was the Graduate Student Representative President. Two years ago I served on the Undergraduate Affairs Committee.

A major stride forward for the Diversity Committee has been to connect with the Equal Opportunity & Discrimination Prevention Office. This office is currently (as of October 2016) working with the CS Department to schedule sensitivity training for all faculty and staff. We are also hoping to hold a similar training or panel with graduate students.

As President, my main role has been to organize grad rep meetings and try to keep monthly discussions relating to graduate student issues alive. I also led the organization of the CS Department's Spring BBQ in May 2016, and was the GSWC 2016 Panel Chair for our CS Summit (or "Department Day") in February 2016.

Two years ago, on the Undergraduate Affairs Committee (2014-2015), my main job was to help plan events for computer science undergraduates. These events are meant to promote diversity, maintain a healthy level of enrollment in our department, and enhance the learning experience of our CS undergraduates at UCSB. The committee planned events such as the Array of Talks and career panels for undergraduates.
