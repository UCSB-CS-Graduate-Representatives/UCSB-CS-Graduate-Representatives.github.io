I'm a third year Ph.D student and a Research Assistant in the Databases, Data Mining and Bioinformatics Lab. My main goals as a representative are:

1. Increasing the visibility of this committee and the GSA;

2. Getting students involved in the several initiatives we are working on;

3. Voicing the interests of the CS students in the GSA and the committes.
