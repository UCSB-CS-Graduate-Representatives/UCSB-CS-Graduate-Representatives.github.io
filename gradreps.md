Graduate Representatives (2014-15)
=======

Each department has a number of representatives to the [Graduate Student Association (GSA)](http://ucsbgsa.org). These representatives are elected each year from the graduate student body. Additionally, representatives take positions on a number of departmental committees to ensure our views are considered. If you would like to fill one of these positions, please contact the GREPs President for more information.
