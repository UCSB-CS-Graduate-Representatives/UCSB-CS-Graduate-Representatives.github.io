Dear CS grads,

Welcome to the 2015-2016 academic year!

This is the time to elect our grad student representatives (gradreps) for the department committees and the [Graduate Student Association](http://www.ucsbgsa.org/)

Being a gradrep is a great way to interact with other grad students, CS faculty, department staff and the UCSB community in general. All the positions are open for nomination and the only requirement for eligibility is to be a CS grad registered for Fall 2015. 

[Here]({{site.baseurl}}/positions/) is a short description of the positions available. And [these]({{site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/) were the representatives elected for the year 2014-2015. 

Nominate yourself by filling [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zog1iinlHSqQVvVdw6cRt-vCjjOEvOdGFiIZc0NIUlY/viewform?usp=send_form). I hope we will have a chance to work together on improving the conditions for graduate students in our department!

The gradreps team for 2014-2015.
