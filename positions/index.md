Positions
=======

Each department has a number of representatives to the [Graduate Student Association (GSA)](http://ucsbgsa.org). These representatives are elected each year from the graduate student body. Additionally, representatives take positions on a number of departmental committees to ensure our views are considered. If you would like to fill one of these positions, please contact us for more information.

<h2 id="commitee_executives">Committee Executives</h2>

The elected GREPs select from among themselves a secretary, treasurer, and president. The secretary keeps the meeting minutes and distributes them via e-mail to all GREPs. The treasurer tracks the GREPs\' funds and manages the budget for the Spring BBQ. The president calls meetings as appropriate and runs the election for the next term with the help of the representative to the Public Relations Committee.

<h2 id="gsa_representatives">GSA Representatives</h2>

It is the responsibility of our department representatives to the GSA to attend the General Assembly meetings and represent the Computer Science graduate students there. Representatives are responsible for passing along to the department's graduate students any relevant information presented at the meetings. GSA Assembly meetings occur monthly (first Tuesday of every month) between 6pm and 8pm. _Regular attendance is important as the GSA provides funding to the GREPs proportional to their attendance._

<h2 id="recruitment_committee">Recruitment Committee</h2>

The Recruitment Committee representative participates in the recruitment of faculty candidates in the department. This committee reviews the applications and invites qualified recruits to interview for available faculty positions. The graduate student representative arranges the lunch meetings that these recruits have with the graduate students and collects feedback to report back to the committee. Being the graduate student representative to the Recruitment Committee may be of major interest to those intending to apply for faculty positions later in their career.

<h2 id="facilities_committee">Facilities Committee</h2>

The student representative on the facilities committee serves as a communicator between the grad students, faculty, and staff on all facilities issues. "Facilities" includes both the physical spaces of the department as well as its computer systems. The representative gathers student comments, concerns, and complaints, and presents these to the committee. Additionally, the representative coordinates with staff and faculty members on the planning of facilities changes. Finally, the representative keeps the student body well-informed of any facilities issues and their resolution.

<h2 id="grad_affairs_committee">Graduate Affairs Committee</h2>

The student representative on the Graduate Affairs Committee is responsible for gathering and voicing the suggestions and complaints of the graduate student body with regards to any issues that pertain to their academic life. Example issues that have fallen upon this committee are: restructuring of screening exams, rising GSR salary levels and early planning/expanding of courses offered by the department. Typically, the Lead TA serves as the representative on this committee.

<h2 id="grad_admissions_committee">Graduate Admissions Committee</h2>

The Graduate Admissions Committee processes all of the new graduate student applications for the department, and selects the most promising candidates for acceptance to the program. The graduate student committee member has the responsibility of monitoring these activities and contributing to the selection process. The representative also plays a critical role in graduate student recruitment.

<h2 id="undergrad_curriculum_committee">Undergraduate Curriculum Committee</h2>

The Undergraduate Curriculum Committee discusses changes to undergraduate courses, makes class schedules, and estimates the number of students that will enroll in each course. Committee members meet to discuss changes to course descriptions and course material. Also, student evaluation statistics are discussed in detail and any appropriate changes are recommended. The committee consists of five professors, one undergraduate student, and one graduate student.

<h2 id="coffee_hour_planner">Coffee Hour Committee</h2>

The Coffee Hour Committee is responsible for coordinating department Coffee Hours throughout the school year. Coffee Hours are periodic, casual meetings that provide a venue for grad students and faculty to mingle and learn more about the research that is going on the department. The grad student representatives sitting on the committee will coordinate logistics with the office, such as budgeting, scheduling, food ordering, and advertising.

<h2 id="undergrad_affairs_committee">Undergraduate Affairs Committee</h2>

The Undergraduate Affairs Committee monitors and proposes changes to the undergraduate programs. This committee also monitors the undergraduate enrollment and develops policies for ensuring a healthy level of undergraduate enrollment in the department. It focuses on advising, events, and anything else that will enhance the experience and learning of our undergraduate students. The graduate student representative on this committee helps steer and plan the focus of events such as the CS Array of Talks and provides input on undergraduate advising and undergraduate enrollment.

<h2 id="department_day_committee">Department Day Committee</h2>

This representative will work with faculty and staff in the organization of our first department day event, which will be a full-day department-wise event showcasing the great work done in our department. In particular, this student will work as the Program Committee (PC) Chair for the research track of the event, which replaces our former Graduate Student Workshop on Computing (GSWC).

<h2 id="diversity_committee">Diversity Committee</h2>

The Diversity Committee is responsible for coordinating outreach and diversity efforts in the department. The graduate student representative will attend the Diversity Committee meetings and provide input, as the representative acts as the interface between the committee and diversity-promoting groups within the department, such as Women in Computer Science (WiCS).

<h2 id="senate_committee">Grad Student Senate (New!) </h2>

Works directly with the chair and staff in the organization of department events and on improving the conditions of graduate students in the department. This group of students is expected to represent all the research labs (roughly, one student per lab), Master's students and Teaching Assistants.
