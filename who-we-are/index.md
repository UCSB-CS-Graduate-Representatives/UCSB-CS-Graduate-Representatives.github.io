Graduate Representatives
-------

Each department has a number of representatives to the [Graduate Student Association (GSA)](http://ucsbgsa.org). Additionally, representatives take positions on a number of departmental committees to ensure our views are considered. These representatives are elected each year at the start of the school year from the graduate student body. If you would like to fill one of these positions, please [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/) for more information. 

If you would like to find out what responsibilities each of these positions hold, [find out here!]({{site.baseurl}}/positions/)
