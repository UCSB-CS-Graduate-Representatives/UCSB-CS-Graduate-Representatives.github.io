Dear CS grads,

Every school year, we elect grad student representatives (gradreps) for the department committees and the [Graduate Student Association](http://www.ucsbgsa.org/)

Being a gradrep is a great way to interact with other grad students, CS faculty, department staff and the UCSB community in general. All the positions are open for nomination and the only requirement for eligibility is to be a CS grad registered for Fall 2015. 

Starting this year, we will also select a student senate that will work closely with the chair and staff in the organization of department events and on improving the conditions of graduate students in the department. This group of students is expected to represent all the research labs (roughly, one student per lab), Master's students and Teaching Assistants.

[Here]({{site.baseurl}}/positions/) is a short description of the positions available. And [these]({{site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/) were the representatives elected for the year 2014-2015. 

Nominate yourself by filling [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zog1iinlHSqQVvVdw6cRt-vCjjOEvOdGFiIZc0NIUlY/viewform?usp=send_form). 

Don't be [this guy](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=784) :-)

We look forward to receiving your nominations! The deadline is October 14th.

The gradreps team for 2014-2015.
