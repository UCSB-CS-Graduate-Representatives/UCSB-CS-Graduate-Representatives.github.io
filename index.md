Welcome
=======

This webpage is maintained by the graduate student representatives as a service to the graduate student body. The CS Department has a number of student representatives that attend most departmental meetings to ensure student issues are considered. Four representatives also attend university-wide GSA assemblies to voice your concerns over issues pertaining to your graduate education.

The list of all positions filled by graduate representatives can be found [here](/gradreps.html).
