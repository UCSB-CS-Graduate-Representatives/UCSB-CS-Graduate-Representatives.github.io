  I am a GSA representative from the Department of Computer Science for 2014-15 academic year. If you have some concerns about your graduate student life, or want to get some resources (e.g., money) from GSA, let me know. Besides that, I do research on mathematical tools for the analysis of large graphs evolving in time.
