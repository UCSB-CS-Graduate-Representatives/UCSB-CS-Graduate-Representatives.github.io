  Hi, my name is Veronika and I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at UCSB. My personal web page is here: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~veronika/

On the Undergraduate Affairs Committee, my main job is to help plan events for computer science undergraduates. These events are meant to promote diversity, maintain a healthy level of enrollment in our department, and enhance the learning experience of our CS undergraduates at UCSB. The committee is currently planning an Array of Talks event scheduled for January 14, 2015. The theme will be "If Only I Had Known...UCSB CS Alumni share their wisdom".
