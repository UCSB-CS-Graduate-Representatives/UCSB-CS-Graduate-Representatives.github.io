What we do
=======

The elected Graduate Student Association (GSA) Representatives go GSA meetings. Find out what happens there by reading the [meeting minutes.](google drive link here)

The elected members of committees attend those committee meetings to ensure that the graduate students views are considered. [Contact your representative](/contact/) if you want to share your thoughts!

We hold coffee hour the first Friday of every month of the school year, bringing together CS graduate students and faculty to delight in free drinks, snacks, and great conversation.
