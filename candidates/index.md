I think the Graduate Student Senate is a great idea for promoting communication between labs in the department; I would like to be a part of making it successful.  I also feel strongly that our quality of life affects how well we can succeed as graduate students.  I think being a part of the Graduate Student Senate and/or a GSA representative would allow me to participate and engage in maintaining and improving on the overall experience of graduate school life here at UCSB.

I was previously the graduate student president for the computer science department at UNC-CH, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my graduate career.  It was a great way to meet students from other disciplines and do what I could to make the department a better place for everyone.  I feel that my experiences at Pitt (undergraduate), UNC-CH (graduate), and MIT (research staff) could provide some valuable insights.

Hey all. I am a second year PhD student interested in network science, NLP and work mixing computational methods with the social sciences and humanities. As an aspiring academic interested in the inner workings of departments, I am running for the faculty recruitment and undergraduate curriculum positions. Furthermore, as a former English major with interdisciplinary interests, I would also like to run for the GSA and help build bridges across departments. Thanks.

My goal is to help make our CS department a top machine learning department. I attended every faculty candidate lecture and lunch last Spring, and I follow the top machine learning journals very closely (the area the department is looking to hire in). I will be able to use my knowledge to help hire a candidate that:
1) is well established and productive in the machine learning community and can advise students to later go on to top positions in academia and industry
2) can bring plenty of grant money so students can focus on research rather than TAing
3) will teach useful machine learning courses so students from other areas such as systems and security can apply machine learning techniques to their own research

I am applying for faculty recruitment position since I am interested in academic jobs later in the career. This experience will give me useful insights about the process and what to expect. I have attended quite a few faculty recruitment talks and meeting with graduate students during my masters at University of Waterloo and I understand the importance and responsibilities of this role.

Hi everyone! I was honored to be the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee grad representative last year and would love to be it again! I did my undergraduate studies here at UCSB so I know the undergrad curriculum very well. I'm very passionate about education, and I especially love helping those that are just starting to learn CS. I was also the lead TA for CS 8, our intro CS class, last year. After graduation, I intend to teach CS courses at the community college level. Thanks for your time! =D

I am invested in recruiting and retaining undergraduates in CS, and want to help streamline their educational experiences.

Hi all! I've enjoyed serving as your gradrep for the past year and, with your support, would love to continue doing so. I'm a second year PhD student and I want to be the epsilon that makes our department a delta more enjoyable!

I am happy to see that the diversity committee has been reinstated. :) I would love to work on creating a more diverse environment for CS graduate students at UCSB. I have some experience in working with under-represented groups in CS, such as the Women in Computer Science (WiCS). Last year I served on the Undergraduate Affairs Committee and learned much about the planning and effort that goes into events put on for the enrichment of CS undergrad lives, such as the Array of Talks. I would like to help the Diversity Committee plan similar events, specifically to promote diversity in our department.
