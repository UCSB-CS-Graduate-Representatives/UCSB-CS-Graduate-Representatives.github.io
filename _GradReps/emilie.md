  I'm a first year Masters student in UCSB's Computer Science Department. I'm a Santa Barbara local and attended UCSB for my undergraduate studies as well. I graduated with two degrees in 2013: a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Mathematics. My research interests include education, foundations, theory and algorithms, and cryptography. Outside of school, I'm an advocate for cat rescue, and volunteer at the local non-profit kitty cat shelter. =^.^=
