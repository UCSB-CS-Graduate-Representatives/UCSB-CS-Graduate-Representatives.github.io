What we do
=======

The elected Graduate Student Association (GSA) Representatives go to GSA meetings. Find out what happens there by reading the [meeting minutes](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B69hCaWL5B4AeEt4OUoyNEtzQk0&usp=sharing) or by checking our [positions](/positions/).

The elected members of committees attend committee meetings to ensure that graduate students views are considered. You can take a look at what we are working on [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B69hCaWL5B4AUFlueFZWUUp2anc&usp=sharing). [Contact your representative](/contact/) if you want to share your thoughts! 

We hold coffee hour the first Friday of every month of the school year, bringing together CS graduate students and faculty to delight in free drinks, snacks, and great conversation. 

We also help organizing the Graduate Student Workshop on Computing (GSWC) that is held every Fall quarter. You can take a look at our [last edition](http://gsrc.cs.ucsb.edu/2014/).
